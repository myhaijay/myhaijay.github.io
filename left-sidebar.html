						<h3>why data</h3>
						<p>Coming from an Information System background, I was already exposed to the nitty-gritties of computers - hardware and software alike. However, with further exposure which I garnered from my first job ever as a Programmer - which took me to the top of the rank in my unit as the Software Support Team Lead in 3 years - it dawned on me that looking at the business of any organization through the eyes of the computer output (data!), could uncover some really interesting aspects of that business.

							This experience birthed my quest into the world of Data Analysis!

						<h4>my journey into the world of data</h4>
						<p>Having delved into the the exciting world of "demystifying" data, it became obvious that it's not enough to analyze data and proffer some insights for business. Consequently, I have gone ahead to strengthen my expertise with other skills like advanced Python programming, advanced SQL, advanced Tableau, Machine Learning and some other required soft skills. </p>

						<p>It is always exciting for me to be offered opportunities where my expertise will find maximum expression for business growth and profit maximization of my employer. </p>
